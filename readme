i created a startup program for termux with using termux api!

put all your startup executables into exec directory. Do not forget to make them
runnable with chmod!

example: 
chmod +x exec/*

you can add your extensions to the path extensions and call them in the startup.sh file.

for opening new session run $NEW

for configure the options to run executables or print yourself to the console:
run nano $CONF
then change the #variable section.
note: the value '1' is standing for true, '0' is representing value false.
